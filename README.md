# Project Overview

This project aims to enhance the responses of a Large Language Model (LLM) by leveraging the learnings from a Graph Neural Network (GNN) model. The process involves extracting style and structure from a dialogue dataset, training a GNN model on this data, and then using the GNN's embeddings to improve the LLM's responses. By capturing the structural and stylistic nuances of the dialogue, we aim to provide additional context to the LLM, thereby improving the quality and relevance of its responses.

## Steps

### Step 1: Extract Style and Structure from Dialogue Dataset

1. **Load the Dataset**:
   - **Description**: We begin by loading the OpenAssistant dataset, which contains a variety of dialogue interactions. To ensure consistency in language processing, we filter the dataset to retain only English text.
   - **Goal**: Prepare a clean and consistent dataset for further analysis.

2. **Select Relevant Fields**:
   - **Description**: From the dataset, we select key fields such as `message_id`, `parent_id`, `text`, and `role`. These fields are essential for understanding the hierarchical structure and content of the dialogues.
   - **Goal**: Isolate the critical elements of the dataset that will be used for analysis and modeling.

3. **Extract Style Features**:
   - **Description**: We analyze the text to extract sentence-level features that capture the style of the dialogue. This includes metrics such as sentence length (number of words), punctuation usage (e.g., question marks and exclamation marks), and vocabulary richness (ratio of unique words to total words).
   - **Goal**: Quantify the stylistic elements of the dialogue to provide additional context for the GNN model.

4. **Save Filtered Data**:
   - **Description**: The filtered and processed dataset is converted into DataFrames and saved as CSV files. This step ensures that the data is readily available for subsequent processing and model training.
   - **Goal**: Persist the processed data for easy access and reuse in later steps.

### Step 2: Build and Train a GNN Model

1. **Initialize a Directed Graph**:
   - **Description**: Using the `networkx` library, we create a directed graph where each node represents a message in the dialogue, and edges represent the parent-child relationships between messages.
   - **Goal**: Model the hierarchical structure of the dialogue as a graph.

2. **Add Nodes and Edges**:
   - **Description**: Nodes are added to the graph with attributes such as `text` and `role`. Edges are added based on the `parent_id` field, establishing the connections between messages.
   - **Goal**: Construct a graph that accurately represents the dialogue structure.

3. **BERT Embeddings**:
   - **Description**: We use a pre-trained BERT model to generate embeddings for the text messages. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text and serve as rich feature vectors for the nodes.
   - **Goal**: Enhance the node features with semantic information from the text.

4. **Combine Features**:
   - **Description**: We combine the BERT embeddings with the previously extracted style features and graph-based features (e.g., node degree, shortest path length). This results in a comprehensive feature vector for each node.
   - **Goal**: Create a robust feature set that encapsulates both the content and structure of the dialogue.

5. **Create PyTorch Geometric Data Object**:
   - **Description**: The graph and node features are converted into a format suitable for PyTorch Geometric, a library designed for deep learning on graph-structured data.
   - **Goal**: Prepare the data for training a GNN model.

6. **Train the GAT Model**:
   - **Description**: We define and train a Graph Attention Network (GAT) model using the combined features. The GAT model leverages attention mechanisms to focus on the most relevant parts of the graph. Techniques like batch normalization and dropout are used to improve training stability and prevent overfitting.
   - **Goal**: Train a GNN model that can learn from the complex structure and features of the dialogue graph.

### Step 3: Integrate GNN Learnings with LLM

1. **Extract Node Embeddings from GAT**:
   - **Description**: After training the GAT model, we extract the node embeddings. These embeddings represent the learned features of each message, capturing both content and structural information.
   - **Goal**: Obtain rich feature representations for each message in the dialogue.

2. **Map Message IDs to Node Embeddings**:
   - **Description**: We create a mapping of message IDs to their corresponding node embeddings. This mapping allows us to easily access the embeddings during inference.
   - **Goal**: Facilitate quick retrieval of node embeddings for any given message.

3. **Generate Responses Using LLM**:
   - **Description**: We use the embeddings to influence the LLM's response generation process. By incorporating the embeddings as additional context in the prompt, we aim to guide the LLM to generate more relevant and contextually aware responses.
   - **Goal**: Enhance the LLM's responses using the learnings from the GNN model.

### Step 4: Generate Responses Using LLM with Embedding Context

1. **Create a Meaningful Prompt**:
   - **Description**: Instead of directly appending the embeddings as text, we create a meaningful prompt that incorporates the embedding context. This prompt provides additional context to the LLM, making it aware of the structural and stylistic features of the dialogue.
   - **Goal**: Provide a well-structured prompt that leverages the embeddings to improve response generation.

2. **Tokenize the Integrated Input**:
   - **Description**: We use a pre-trained tokenizer (e.g., GPT-2 tokenizer) to tokenize the integrated input. This step ensures that the input is in a format suitable for the LLM.
   - **Goal**: Prepare the integrated input for the LLM.

3. **Generate Response**:
   - **Description**: Using the LLM, we generate a response based on the integrated input. The additional context provided by the GNN embeddings helps the LLM generate more relevant and coherent responses.
   - **Goal**: Produce high-quality responses by leveraging the learnings from the GNN model.

## Conclusion

By following these steps, you can enhance the responses of an LLM using the learnings from a GNN model. The GNN model captures structural and stylistic features of the dialogue, which are then used to provide additional context to the LLM. This approach potentially improves the quality and relevance of the generated responses, making the LLM more effective in understanding and responding to dialogue.
